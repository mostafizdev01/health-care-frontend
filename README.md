üé® Design & UX Notes
Use large, legible type scale for accessibility.

Primary action (Appointment/Book) should stand out ‚Äî recommended bg-blue-600 with white text.

Secondary action (View Profile) as outline for clear visual hierarchy.

Maintain consistent spacing and rounded corners (rounded-lg).

Use soft shadows for card elevation but avoid heavy gradients that reduce readability.

‚ôø Accessibility & Performance
All interactive elements have keyboard focus states and proper aria-* attributes.

Images include descriptive alt text.

Lighthouse target: > 90 Performance, > 90 Accessibility

Use next/image for optimized loading & responsive images.

Code-splitting and route-level lazy loading for heavier components (video chat, map).

‚úÖ Testing
Unit and component tests with Jest + React Testing Library

Example:

bash
Copy code
pnpm test
Add E2E tests with Playwright or Cypress for booking flows
